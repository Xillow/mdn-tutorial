    <h2>A Better League of Legends Overlay Experience</h2>
    <img src="images/umbc-league-overlay-old.png" alt="A mock overlay for League of Legends for UMBC">
    <p>This was created for when I was trying to create a better viewing experience 
      for those watching tournaments hosted or casted by UMBC Students. We weren't able to
      use the overlay much since we couldn't find many casters, but it was in my opinion 
      well made and ready to use at any time.</p>
